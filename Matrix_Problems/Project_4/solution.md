## 1.4.  Partition of 225 freshmen students in 15 groups of 15 students in each(2 points)
* (a)  For  each  student  3-vector  is  available.   These  vectors  containNAEC  examination  scores  in  Georgian  language,  English  language and mathematics.
* (b)  Requirement is that each group should have approximately similar strength from the viewpoint of NAEC examination scores.
* (c)  Compare groups using matrix norm.  Which norm is better for the task?
* (d)  Describe your approach and algorithm.  Give reasons for justify-ing your choice.
* (e)  Generate synthetic data, run code, visualize output;

### Conclusion:
I used frobenius norm for this task. Added with backtracking algorithm to find all permutations and choose the best ones.
